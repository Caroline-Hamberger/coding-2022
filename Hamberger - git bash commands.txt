I'll be copying all of my code into this document.

Git bash & Git hub:

	git clone https://github.com/Caroline-Hamberger/coding-2022.git -> cloned my repository from git hub to git bash
	ls -> checked files in folder
	cd coding-2022/ -> navigated to correct folder
	ls -> checked files in folder
	nano final_assignment_git -> made changes to the document
	git status -> checked status (red, no comments yet)
	git add final_assignment_git -> added comments on document changes
	git staus -> checked status (green)
	git commit final_assignment_git -> commited
	git push -> pushed to git hub
	git mv README.md new_file_name -> renamed file
