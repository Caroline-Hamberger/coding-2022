This is the assignment for "Coding for Economists"

The file "final_assignment-git" is simply the (mostly) empty file used for pulling and pushing to github.

The documentation of the project is in three files, labeled Hamberger - stata / git bash commands / python

All other files are other things done in Stata (like saving the regression etc)
