This is the assignment for "Coding for Economists"

The file final_assignment-git is simply the (mostly) empty file used for pulling and pushing to github
The documentation of the project is in three files, labeled Hamberger - stata / git bash commands / python

All other files are other things done in Stata (like saving the regression etc)
